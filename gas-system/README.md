## 🎯 How to Use

### CLI Interface (Natural Language)
```bash
# No commands needed - just tell it what you want!
gas "build my project"
gas "fix the broken tests"  
gas "organize my project files"
gas "remember this solution for later"
gas "research React best practices"
gas "create a new component called UserProfile"
gas "optimize this code for performance"
```

### Web Dashboard
```bash
npm run dashboard
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**Visual command center** with real-time monitoring:
- 📊 System status and health
- 🧠 AI reasoning visualization  
- 💾 Memory system explorer
- 🤖 Agent orchestration view
- 🔒 Security monitoring
- 📈 Cost and performance analytics

## 🚀 What GAS Can Do

### 🔧 Development Tasks
- **"build my project"** → Runs optimized build with best practices
- **"run the tests"** → Executes test suites and reports results
- **"fix this bug"** → Analyzes code, identifies issues, applies fixes
- **"create a React component"** → Generates component with modern patterns
- **"deploy to production"** → Handles deployment with safety checks

### 📁 Organization & Management
- **"organize my files"** → Cleans up and structures your project
- **"remember this architecture"** → Stores patterns for future use  
- **"what was that solution we used?"** → Retrieves past solutions
- **"keep track of my progress"** → Maintains project status

### 🧠 Learning & Research
- **"explain this code to me"** → Analyzes and explains complex code
- **"research the best approach for X"** → Finds optimal solutions
- **"what are the alternatives?"** → Compares different options
- **"learn from this mistake"** → Updates knowledge base

### ⚡ Problem Solving
- **"something's broken"** → Diagnoses and fixes issues automatically
- **"make this faster"** → Optimizes performance bottlenecks
- **"reduce costs"** → Switches to cheaper but effective approaches
- **"figure out why X isn't working"** → Systematic troubleshooting

## 🧠 AI Intelligence System

### Multi-Model Orchestration
- **Claude**: Complex reasoning, analysis, writing (200K context)
- **GPT-4**: Code generation, technical tasks (128K context)  
- **Gemini**: Research, web browsing (2M context window)
- **Local**: Private data, sensitive operations (unlimited, free)

**GAS automatically selects the best AI for each task** based on:
- Task complexity
- Context requirements
- Cost optimization
- Privacy needs

### 🤖 Specialized Agents
- **Tool Agent**: Manages external tools and integrations
- **Memory Agent**: Handles all memory operations and retrieval
- **Security Agent**: Manages credentials and access control
- **Reasoning Agent**: Makes complex decisions and coordinates

## 💾 Memory System

### What GAS Remembers
- **Every conversation** - never forgets context
- **Your preferences** - learns how you like things done
- **Project patterns** - remembers successful approaches
- **Solutions** - stores fixes for future reference
- **Relationships** - understands how things connect
- **Goals** - keeps track of what you're trying to achieve

### Persistent Context
- Pick up exactly where you left off
- Maintains context across sessions
- Links related conversations and projects
- Builds comprehensive knowledge about you and your work

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Local-first**: Sensitive data never leaves your machine
- **Encrypted storage**: All credentials and personal data protected
- **Zero-trust security**: Granular access controls
- **Audit logging**: Complete visibility into system activities

```bash
# Check .env file has correct keys
# Verify API key permissions
gas --status  # Check connection status
```

**"Commands not recognized"**
```bash
# Make sure you're using natural language
✅ "build my project" 
❌ "npm run build"
```

**"Memory not working"**
```bash
# Check if memory system initialized
gas --status
# Clear and rebuild if needed
```
